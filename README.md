Data Analysis for BottleNeck Wine Merchant

In this project, I am tasked with reconciling sales and inventory data from two separate sources to help BottleNeck optimize its operations and better understand its online sales performance. The goal is to bridge the gap between the ERP system and the e-commerce platform, analyze the financial performance, and detect any pricing inconsistencies.
 
Key Skills Acquired:

    Data Reconciliation: Merging two distinct datasets (ERP and e-commerce) using reference keys to align product information, sales, and stock data.
    Sales Analysis: Calculating total sales revenue per product and for the entire e-commerce platform.
    Outlier Detection: Identifying and visualizing pricing errors or anomalies that could signal data entry mistakes.
    Data Cleaning and Validation: Ensuring data integrity through verification of keys, join consistency, and cleaning erroneous data.
    Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual variables, such as prices and sales, to detect outliers and trends.
    Data Visualization: Presenting the findings in a clear and actionable format for business stakeholders.

Technologies Used:

    Python: For data analysis, merging datasets, and statistical computations.
    Pandas / NumPy: For data manipulation and cleaning tasks.
    Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualizing the results of the sales analysis and pricing discrepancies.
    Jupyter Notebooks: For documenting and presenting the analysis.
