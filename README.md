# Optimizing Data Management for a Retail Business

This GitHub repository details our project aimed at optimizing data management for a retail business. Our mission is to integrate two distinct databases: one containing data on physical resource management and the other hosting information on marketed products available online. A third file will assist in bridging these databases. Our primary goal is to ensure the reliability of the link between these data sources before merging them. Once combined, we will analyze the consolidated data to ensure coherence and draw actionable insights to improve business operations.

# Part 1: Data Preparation

- Importing Libraries: Setting up the analysis environment with necessary programming libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- Importing Data: Loading the physical resources data file and the online product information file.
- Data Processing: Cleaning and structuring the data for integration, focusing on:
- Liaison: Preparing the linking file to ensure accurate matching between the databases.
- ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning): Processing the physical resources data to align with business operations.
- Web: Cleaning and organizing the online product information for accurate integration.

# Part 2: Data Analysis

- Joining ERP and Web Data: Merging the physical resource management data with the online product information to create a unified database.
- Revenue by Product: Calculating and analyzing the revenue generated by each product to identify top performers and underperformers.
- Total Revenue: Summarizing the overall revenue to assess the financial health of the business.
- Price Analysis: Evaluating the pricing structure of products to identify opportunities for optimization and competitive positioning.

# Conclusion:

This project aims to enhance the retail business's data management practices by ensuring the seamless integration of disparate data sources, thus providing a holistic view of business operations. Through detailed data preparation and insightful analysis, we aim to support better decision-making, enhance operational efficiency, and drive business growth.
